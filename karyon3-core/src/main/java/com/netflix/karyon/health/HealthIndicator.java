/**
 * Basic interface for defining health indication logic.  0 or more HealthIndicators are used to determine 
 * the application {@link HealthCheck}.  HealthIndicators are tracked by a {@link HealthIndicatorRegistry}
 * where the default implementation uses all HealthIndicators registered as a set multibinding.  
 * 
 * HealthIndicator can inject types that are to be consulted for health indication, call out to shell 
 * scripts or call a remote service.  
 * 
 * To register a health indicator,
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Multbindings.newSetBinder(binder()).addBinding().to(MyHealthIndicator.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *  
 * Here is a sample health indicator implementation. 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * public class MyHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
 *     @Inject
 *     public MyHealthIndicator(MyService service) {
 *         this.service = service;
 *     }
 *     
 *     @Override
 *     public CompletableFuture<HealthIndicatorStatus> check() {
 *          if (service.getErrorRate() > 0.1) {
 *              return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(HealthIndicatorStatuses.unhealthy(getName()));
 *          }
 *          else {
 *              return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(HealthIndicatorStatuses.healthy(getName()));
 *          }
 *     }
 * }
